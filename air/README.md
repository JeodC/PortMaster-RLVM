## Installation
You need a copy of [Air Standard Edition](https://vndb.org/r87). Install the `rlvm` runtime and copy the game files to `ports/air/gamedata`.

## Notes
Air Standard Edition has an [English Patch](https://winter-confetti.blogspot.com/2014/04/air-standard-edition-2005-english-patch.html). Other versions and patches are untested. 

This port is marked experimental because we can't save and load games due to the inability to display the right-click context menu.

## Installation
You need a copy of [Kanon Standard Edition](https://vndb.org/r274) or [All Ages](https://vndb.org/r275). Install the `rlvm` runtime and copy the game files to `ports/kanon/gamedata`.

Kanon HD does _not_ work!

## Notes
Kanon has an [English Patch](https://www.gamepressure.com/download.asp?ID=77952) that can be applied to the [Standard](https://vndb.org/r274) or [All Ages](https://vndb.org/r275) editions.

This port is marked experimental because we can't save and load games due to the inability to display the right-click context menu.
